### üó£Ô∏è About

> _The goal of these modules is to introduce to Object-Oriented Programming._

####

- CPP is the name of the C++ mini pool at 42, a set of several lists of exercises that go from object-oriented basics like polymorphism and inheritance to C++ templates.
  C++ (said C plus plus) is an object-oriented computer language created by notable computer scientist Bjorne Stroustrop as part of the evolution of the C family of languages. It was developed as a cross-platform improvement of C to provide developers with a higher degree of control over memory and system resources.

## OPP Intro

What Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is

- OOP bundles data & the functions which act on it together. It can aid conceptualising a program, because in calling a member function, one if effectively telling the data what to do to itself

- Data hiding. Just like functions can have local variables not visible to the rest of the program, so can objects. This is for storing data that is not revealed or set directly but only via methods (member functions)

- Automatic initialisation. A class can have a method (a constructor) which is automatically called whenever a new object of that class comes into being. There is a corresponding method (a destructor') which is called when an object is disposed of and is typically used for clearing up

- Same name, different function. Different functions can have the same name provided they are distinguished by their parameter types. This is useful in procedural languages but is almost vital in OOP languages. In OOP, this ability to have multiple functions with the same name is called overloading

- Derived classes. If one requires a class which like a class one already has but requires extra features then one can derive a class from an existing class
